### 1. Project Introduction

#### 1.1 Overview
This data analysis project explores employee performance and satisfaction levels and their correlation with other factors such as education level, work-life balance, and training opportunities. By leveraging data analytics, we aim to derive actionable insights that can help improve workforce management and performance evaluation.

#### 1.2 Objectives
- **Analyze employee performance ratings** and their influencing factors.
- **Identify trends in job satisfaction and attrition.**
- **Correlate education levels with employee performance.**
- **Provide actionable insights for HR decision-making** using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

#### 1.3 Scope
- Focus solely on the data provided by the CSV files.
- Cover data extraction, cleaning, integration, and exploratory analysis.
- Provide recommendations based on the analysis for improved employee management practices.
- Limit the scope to internal HR performance analytics without integrating external data sources.
